# Client-Side Field-Level Encryption (CSFLE)

This example is adapted from the [mongodb samples](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/tutorials/#std-label-csfle-tutorial-automatic-encryption).

It uses a Local (Read: **NOT PRODUCTION SAFE** ) key using the `crypt_shared` tools (you can find on the MongoDB download pages tucked under "package" for the [Enterprise variant](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise) )
